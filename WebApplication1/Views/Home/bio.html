Hello, my name is Jimmy Parker. I am currently 26 years old and am attending East Tennessee State University in the Information Technology concentration. Currently I am expected to graduate in Fall 2020 and frankly cannot wait to be done with classes.
I am married to my lovely wife Amy who is currently a resident pediatrician at Niswonger Childrens and have a bouncing baby boy named Wyatt who is growing way too quickly at going on 9 months old.
